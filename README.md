# Electorn-Scattering analysis

In order to run this code, you will need nfs data installed onto your system

I recommend running this on an IDE, but the terminal should work fine.

1. Download the Carbon.java and PB.java from this repo
2. To see proton identification, run PID.java
3. To look at the kinematics, run kinematics.java
4. To look at the ratios of the proton and electorn, run the files provided in the Ratios file
5. To look at the multiplicity ratios, run the provided files inside the mult_ratios file
